# ðŸš€ ENGINE-AJ-WINDOWS v1.1.2 Release Notes

### âœ… v1.1.2 - Verified Delivery
- Replaced outdated XPath with:
  ```
//div[@role="textbox" and @contenteditable="true"]
  ```
- Verified compatibility with modern WhatsApp Web
- JS click attempt happens first
- If JS fails: falls back to real mouse movement
- If mouse fails: sends RETURN key
- Confirmed RETURN key fallback works only if the message box clears. Prevents false positives and boosts AJ-trust levels ðŸ’¯

Built with passion, code, coffee, and just a little bit of madness.
